# wasp-kiwi
Welcome to wasp-kiwi! This repository contains the containers developed for the
KIWI 2.0 car platform during the WASP summer school of 2018.

## Project description
The purpose of the project was to develop a control system enabling a KIWI car
to follow a leader at a fixed distance based on taken images and ultrasonic
distance measurements. In groups of two, students were given some flexibility
in defining both the problem and the solution, with many ending up using OpenCV
with simpler P or PD controllers. However, as the found solutions differed between
the groups, the repository is structured in a set of X directories named `/groupX`,
each containing the source code developed by the corresponding group and a
short description of the solutions.

## Installation
Please refer to the repository with the stock [KIWI code ](https://github.com/chalmers-revere/2018-wasp-summer-school) for installation instructions and
additional details on operating the car.
