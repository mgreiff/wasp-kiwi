This repository contains the containers developed for the KIWI 2.0 car platform
during the WASP summer school of 2018.

## Project description
The purpose of the project was to develop a control system enabling a KIWI car
to follow a leader at a fixed distance based on taken images and ultrasonic
distance measurements. In groups of two, students were given some flexibility
in defining both the problem and the solution, with many ending up using OpenCV
with simpler P or PD conttrolles. However, the found solutions differed between
the groups, and the repository is therefore structured in a set of X directories
named ``/groupX'', each containing the source code developed by the
corresponding group and a short description of the solutions.

## Installation
TODO: write out installation instructions.
